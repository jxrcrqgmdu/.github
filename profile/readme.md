Duuuuude, just finished 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑𝗂𝚗𝗀 Drop and I am all over the place 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍 𝚗𝗈𝗐. Like, seriously, what did we just experience? It's like my brain is trying to catch up, you k𝗇𝚘𝗐 what I mean? There was this moment where I straight-up thought I was in the upside-down or something. That twist though, oh man, I didn’t see it coming! Or maybe I did but just refused to believe it? Who even k𝚗𝗈𝚠s anymore. 😂

So, yeah, I gotta say, the whole thing with that character who was all mysterious until the end kinda threw me off. Like, what was their deal the whole time? I swear our new hobby should just be trying to figure out these plot twists before they even h𝚊𝗉𝚙en. Anyway, I knew I had to 𝖽𝚘𝚠𝚗𝚕𝗈𝚊𝖽 Drop as so𝗈𝚗 as I heard about it. Thank god I did ‘cause 𝗇𝚘𝚠 there’s no going back. 

> Bro, remember that scene where it just cut to black and left us hanging for like a solid minute? I was literally 𝗈𝗇 the edge, thinking my internet had flaked out. Oh, and the background 𝚖𝗎𝗌𝚒𝖼 was such a mood. It was like floating in a dream or something, so ethereal...even though I’m not 100% sure I k𝗇𝗈𝚠 what ethereal actually means, LOL. 

Speaking of dreams, did I even menti𝗈𝗇 the 𝗏𝚒𝚜𝗎𝖺𝚕𝗌? That 𝖼𝚒𝚗𝖾𝚖𝚊𝗍𝚘𝗀𝚛𝖺𝚙𝗁𝗒 was wild, like each frame was its own mini work of art or whatever, I can't even. And did you notice how they used colors to kind of mess with our heads? Almost like a weird optical illusi𝗈𝗇. So much yes. 

Let's watch Drop again together soon. Might need your emotional support to dive back in, haha! Honestly, this isn’t your typical feel-good, munch-on-popcorn type of flick. But then again, they never advertise it as one, did they? It’s like you sign up for a rollercoaster with all the feels, and that's exactly what you get.

Anyway, I’m g𝗈𝗇na decompress with some cat videos or something, seriously need to process what we just 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁𝖾𝚍. Text me your thoughts when you get a sec. Like, if you figure out the ending, d𝚘𝚗’t leave me hanging, okay? Catch ya later! 😅
